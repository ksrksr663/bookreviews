# Book Review Website

This Python web application allows users to register, log in using their username and password, and search for books, leave reviews, see reviews from other users, and see the ratings of books made by other people thanks to the Goodreads API. This app can also function as an API, allowing a user to query for book details/reviews. This project was inspired by project 1 of CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.
